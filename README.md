# College-Chef
A group project for CSC309. 

A website that queries through recipes using the ingredients the user has available to them. Based on the idea of a college student hot having the necessary skills or ingredients to cook proper meals, College Chef allows students to find recipes based on the ingredients they have lying around in their fridges
